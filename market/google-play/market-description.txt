GroestlPay Wallet

Secure Groestlcoin on your own terms with an open source, multisignature wallet.

GroestlPay users can hold funds individually or share finances securely with other users with multisignature wallets, which prevent unauthorized payments by requiring multiple approvals. Here are some ways GroestlPay can be used with others:

To save for vacations or joint purchases with friends
To track family spending and allowances
To manage business, club, or organization funds and expenses

We built the following features into this version of GroestlPay for a Groestlcoin wallet that doesn't compromise on security or accessibility:

Multiple Groestlcoin wallet creation and management in-app
Integration for buying and selling Groestlcoin.
Intuitive multisignature security for personal or shared wallets
Device-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud
Hierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and wallet backups
Payment protocol (BIP70-BIP73) support: easily-identifiable payment requests and verifiably secure groestlcoin payments
Support for 150+ currency pricing options and unit denomination in GRS or uGRS
Email and push notifications for payments and transfers
Easy spending proposal flow for shared wallets and group payments
Customizable wallet naming and background colors
Multiple supported languages, including French, German, Chinese (Simplified), and Spanish

GroestlPay is free and open source software. Anyone can review or contribute to GroestlPay's source code on GitHub (https://github.com/Groestlcoin/GroestlPay).  This is fork of Copay.
